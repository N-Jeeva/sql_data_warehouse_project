# SQL DATA WAREHOUSE AND ANALYTICS PROJECT
Building a modern data warehouse with MySQL including ETL, data modelling and analytics
This project demonstrates how a data warehouse is created from the start to the end using SQL Server and how the analytical insights can be taken out from the datasets.
The project requirements and the objective of this project are listed below.



## Project Requirements


### 1. Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

- **Goal**:  
        Build a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server** to combine sales data, create useful reports, and help make smart business decisions.

- **Details**:
  - **Data Sources**:  
        Use CSV files from two systems:  
          - ERP (for business operations)

  - **Data Cleaning**:  
        Fix errors and make sure the data is clean before using it.

  - **Data Integration**:  
        Merge both sources into one simple and easy-to-use format for analysis.

  - **Scope**:  
        Only use the latest data. No need to include old or past records.

  - **Documentation**:  
        Write clear notes explaining how the data is organized, so business users and analysts can understand it easily.


### **2. BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)**

- **Goal**:  
      Use **SQL queries** to find useful insights from the data.

- **Focus Areas**:
